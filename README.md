# NodeJS samples for Indy SDK illustrating self-sovereign identity (SSI)

This demo illustrates how identity blockchain agents can be used to issue verifiable credential from an issuer to a prover and later verified by a verifier using a proof.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/TrustNetPK/trustnet-nodejs-sample.git
cd trustnet-nodejs-sample
(indy-sdk is the main package used for this project)
npm install
```
### To run verifier
```
cd trustnet-nodejs-sample/src
node verifier.js
```

### To run prover
```
cd trustnet-nodejs-sample/src
node prover.js
```

### To run issuer
```
cd trustnet-nodejs-sample/src
node issuer.js
```

# This is the demo of our current progress that just shows the basic of SSI.
